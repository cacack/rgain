Put 'replaygain.py' into either ~/.quodlibet/plugins/songsmenu/ or your
system-wide QL plugin directory (sorry, you'll need to find that yourself).
Then, activate it in QL's plugins dialogue. 'rgain' will have to be installed
(for the Python version you're running QL on; as that will usually be the system
Python in both cases, it should work out most of the time).
